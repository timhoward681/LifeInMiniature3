# LifeInMiniature3

A website to allow artists to display their work. This will include paints used and eventually links to purchase miniatures and paints. Life In Miniature will also tell a bio
about the artists. What made them become interested in painting miniatures and what they get personally from painting miniatures. My goal is to celebrate artists and
hopefully show how painting miniatures can potentially be theraputic. Like painting one's own drow warlock sand mandala.
