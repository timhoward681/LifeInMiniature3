# LifeInMiniature3

A website to allow artists who paint miniature figures to display their work. Life In Miniature will also explore what made the artists interested in painting miniatures and what they get personally from painting miniatures. My goal is to celebrate artists and educate site visitors about an artform that they may not be as familiar with. Eventually, I would like to add links to the paints used by the artists and the miniatures on display.


**CSS FEATURES**
1) The navigation menu changes from a mobile friendly vertical list to a horizontal row for desktop and tablet.
2) The image can be clicked on to magnify it in mobile and desktop views.
3) In mobile mode, all of the information is arranged in one column. In desktop mode, it is two columns.

**Java Features**
1) Contact form that alerts the user when their email is an invalid form.
2) The submit button is connected to my personal email (via Formspree) so that when a user enters their information and a message it is sent to me.
    - I have not setup my email address on Formspree so currently it goes to a formspree broken link page.
